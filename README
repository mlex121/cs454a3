===== Build Process =====
We have used cmake as our build tool, along with an out of source build

To compile, enter the ./build directory, and execute:

cmake ..
make

This will create a ./bin directory, which contains:

binder
librpc.a

There are a number of other binary files which will be created in this directory, but they can
be safely ignored.

Finally, the client and server can be compiled with:
g++ -L. client.o -lrpc -o client
g++ -L. server_functions.o server_function_skels.o server.o -lrpc -pthread -o server

Observe that the server REQUIRES "-pthread" for the pthreads library
